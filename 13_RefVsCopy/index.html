    // start with strings, numbers and booleans(all 3 same behaviour -> On var2 = var1, it is copy not reference)

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(players, team); // it changes both of the arrays. Because doing team = players is by reference
    

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // way1
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    // way2
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    // way3
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'heeee hawww';
    console.log(team4);

    // way4
    const team5 = Array.from(players);


    // The same thing goes for objects
    // with Objects
    const person = {

      age: 80

    const captain = person;

    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });
    console.log(cap2);
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread 
    // const cap3 = {...person}; (this functionality is not yet there)

    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'

    console.clear();

    //making copy of wes
    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
    dev.name = 'wesley';
    console.log(wes, dev) //both are different by names

    //BUT
    dev.social.twitter = '@coolman';
    console.log(wes, dev) //social changes for both. Bcoz Object.assign is just 1 level deep

    //to make a copy for all levels use cloneDeep method or use below method:
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
